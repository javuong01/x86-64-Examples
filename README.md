# x86-64-Examples
3 Small Examples of x86-64 work.

Check Bits: 
This  function  takes  as  argument  threeintegers.  The second and third integer specify bit numbers (let’s call themaandb), with 0 representing the least significantbit.  The function should return 1 if the first argument’s bit pattern has bitsaandbset (to 1).  If this is not the case, thenthe function should return 0.  You may assume that 0≤a≤31, 0≤b≤31, and a not equal to b.

Matrix Transpose:
This function transposes a matrix, reflecting it across its diagonal. 

Aaronization:
This function takes an array of integers and transforms it. The first and last element of the array are increased by the second and second to last element respectively. All other elements are increased by the values of the elements one index lower and one index higher.
